## JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most complicated ones to support, because of all the
EcmaScript features and libraries that add TypeScript-like type hints.
Nonetheless, DoGe supports all of it.

Supported:
- Regular functions
- Prototype functions
- ES6
  - Fat-arrow functions
  - Classes
  - Class methods
  - Destructuring in parameter lists
- FlowJS/TypeScript-like type hints

All of the above is _also_ supported for TypeScript and NodeJS.
